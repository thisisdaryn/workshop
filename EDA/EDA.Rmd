### A note 

These slides assume your working directory contains the *data* folder that contains the following files:
  - *Loans.csv*
  - *ChicagoEmployees.csv*

One way to ensure that you are in that directory is to open the *week2.Rproj* file. (After downloading the project folder *week2* from elearning.)

You can do this in RStudio by File --> Open Project and then navigating to it at the location you downloaded it to.


---
### Let's start with the iris data set. 


Here are the first few rows of the data frame (using the **head** function):
```{r}
head(iris)
```


Btw, there is also a **tail** function, that lets you look at the last few rows of the data.


---
### Getting a first look at a data set

A function that often comes in handy when first exploring a data set is **summary**
--
```{r}
summary(iris)
```
--
It provides summary statistics for the columns (variables) in the data frame.
---
#### Calculating summary statistics on your own:

How would you calculate some of those summary statistics on your own? e.g. for the mean and median of the sepal widths:

--

First, **mean**:
```{r}
mean(iris$Sepal.Width)
```
--
Then, **median**
```{r}
median(iris$Sepal.Width)
```


The mean and the median look very close to each other. 

---
### Is the distribution symmetric?
We can plot a histogram:
--
```{r fig.height = 5}
hist(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

---
### We can customise plots using extra parameters:  
--
```{r fig.height = 5}
hist(iris$Sepal.Width, xlab = "Sepal Width", main = "Iris Data Set", 
     col = "royalblue") 
```


---
### What about the relationship between Sepal width and length?

To show the relationship between two numerical variables we use **plot**:
--

```{r fig.height = 4.5}
plot(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Sepal.Length)
```

This relationship does not appear to be very strong. What is the correlation?
---

### Calculating correlation

We can use **cor**:
--
```{r}
cor(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Sepal.Length)
```
--
This is a weakly negative correlation i.e. length seems to generally decrease slightly with increases in width (and vice versa).


---
### Is there a relationship between the widths and lengths of the petals?
--

Here's the scatterplot:
```{r fig.height = 4}
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```
--


Ok, this correlation looks pretty strong to me.
--
```{r}
cor(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

---

### What about Variance and standard deviation?

Variances and standard deviations of vectors, can be found using the **var** and **sd** functions respectively:
--

```{r}
var(iris$Petal.Length)
```
--

```{r}
sd(iris$Petal.Length)
```


---

### Making boxplots to compare distributions

You can use **boxplot** to compare numeric variables across the levels of a categorical variable. (The syntax we will use is slightly different to what we have used before):
--
```{r fig.height=5}
boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
```



---
### Ok, now to work with data in a file 

The **list.files** function can be used to see the files in a directory.

```{r}
list.files("data")
```

--

This shows the 2 data sets in the data directory. 

We can read in the *loans* data set using the function **read.csv**
--
```{r}
#loans <- read.csv("data/Loans.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

--

The loans data set has 10,000 rows and 17 columns

```{r}
dim(loans)
```

If you are using RStudio, you should see it in the Environment window. (And you can browse it in the source pane by clicking on the name *loans*).

---
### Getting counts of categorical variables

An extremely useful function is **table** which gets counts of categorical variables. 

--

Using **table** to get the counts of different levels of the <tt>homeownership</tt> variable as in Figure 2.18 of the text.
--
```{r}
table(loans$homeownership)
```

---
### Making contingency tables

We can also use **table** with 2 variables to make a table like the one in Figure 2.17 of the text:
--
```{r}
table(loans$app_type, loans$homeownership)
```
--

The **addmargins** function can be used to include the totals:
--
```{r}
addmargins(table(loans$app_type, loans$homeownership))
```
---


### A Slightly different way to do it

Note that we could have chosen to store the results of the **table** function to a variable as an intermediate step instead:
--
```{r}
ownapps <- table(loans$app_type, loans$homeownership)
addmargins(ownapps)
```

---
### Ok, now to make some bar plots

First get the counts of the *homeownership* levels:

```{r}
ownership_counts <- table(loans$homeownership)
```
--

Now to put them into the **barplot** function:
--
```{r fig.height = 4}
barplot(ownership_counts)
```


---
### What about barplots with 2d tables?

--

We can also use the 2d table, <tt>ownapps</tt> created previously:

--
```{r fig.height=5}
barplot(ownapps) 
```

---
### Are there other ways to show this bar chart?  

--

Real answer: Yes, you can customise plots as much as you want in R

--

For now: we will use the *beside* argument:
--

```{r fig.height=5}
barplot(ownapps, beside = TRUE)
```



---
### A little bit of customising

--
First, we will make a vector of colours. (Most common colour names are available):
--
```{r}
colours <- c("blue", "yellow")
```

--
Now to apply it to the plot, using the *col* argument:
--
```{r fig.height = 5}
barplot(ownapps, beside = TRUE, col = colours)
```


---
### Adding a legend to the plot

A legend can be added by running the **legend** command immediately after the **barplot** function:
--
```{r fig.height=5}
barplot(ownapps, beside = TRUE, col = colours)
legend("top", legend = rownames(ownapps), fill = colours)
```


---
### A brief pause: where did rownames come from?

Remember that *ownapps* was a 2d table.
--
```{r}
ownapps
```
--

You can get the names of the rows in a table using the function **rownames**:
--
```{r}
rownames(ownapps)
```

--

And you can get the column names using the function **colnames**:
--
```{r}
colnames(ownapps)
```







---
### Using other colours if you wish

Other colours can be selected using <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">html colour codes</a>. For example, we can use a colour scheme close to the text's:
--
```{r}
new_colours <- c("#569BBD", "#F4DD00")
```

Now run similar code as before for the plot:
--
```{r fig.height = 4.5}
barplot(ownapps, beside = TRUE, col = new_colours)
legend("top", legend = rownames(ownapps), fill = new_colours)
```


---
### Ending note


 - There were quite a few commands used in these slides. Some are more important than others and you will find them recurring more frequently in your use of R.  
 

  - for many mathematical functions the corresponding R function is usually easy to figure out e.g. **mean**, **median**, **sd**, **min**, **max**
